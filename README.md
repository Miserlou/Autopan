# BX$$ Autopan

BX$$ Autopan automatically pans a signal back and forth between left and right channels. You can control the speed, depth and shape of the panning.

BX$$ Autopan is a 32-bit VST for ~~Windows~~ and OSX created in SonicBirth.

### Update

Well, I fucked up. Turns out SonicBirth 1 can't make Windows VSTs, which was the whole purpose of this project. I will need to port this to SonicBirth 2 now, which will mean losing the fancy GUI, and possibly remaking the whole circuit. 

Still, there is a zipped binary download available for OSX available in this repository now.
